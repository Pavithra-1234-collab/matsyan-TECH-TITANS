🐟 SmartFishNet – AI-Powered Real-Time Fish Catch Predictor
SmartFishNet is an intelligent, real-time fish catch prediction system designed to assist fishermen in identifying the best fishing zones using a combination of satellite,
oceanographic, and weather data. It enhances safety, efficiency, and sustainability in fishing operations. 

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Small-scale fishermen often rely on traditional methods to decide where and when to fish, leading to:
- 🌊 Wasted fuel and time on unproductive trips  
- 🐠 Overfishing in ecologically fragile zones  
- 💸 Unpredictable income and economic insecurity  
- ⛈️ Safety risks during unstable weather  
- 🛰️ Low adoption of modern technology due to cost/accessibility

## ✅ Solution
SmartFishNet provides:
- 🎯 **AI-based prediction** of fish species and expected catch volume (kg)  
- 🗺️ Interactive maps showing fishing hotspots  
- 🌤️ Weather and tide alerts for safety  
- 🌐 Works online/offline with minimal bandwidth  
- 🧠 Uses real-world and crowdsourced catch data to train models

## ⚙️ Tech Stack Used
**AI/ML & Data Science**  
- Python, scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas  
- Regression & Classification Models  
- Pickled `.pkl` models (joblib or pickle)
- model training(google collab)

**Backend**  
- Flask
- FastAPI  
- Pydantic (for data validation)  
- Uvicorn (server)

**Frontend**  
- HTML CSS
-JAVASCRIPT
-Browser LocalStorage for Frontend
- Mapbox / Leaflet.js for map view  
- Axios (for API requests)
